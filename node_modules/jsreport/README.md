**Open source platform for designing and rendering various reports.**

jsreport is a reporting server which lets developers define reports using  javascript templating engines (like jsrender or handlebars). It supports various report output formats like html, pdf, excel and others.  It also includes advanced reporting features like user management, REST API, scheduling, designer or sending emails.

You can find more information on the official project website http://jsreport.net

## Production installation
see [http://jsreport.net/downloads](http://jsreport.net/downloads)

## Development
To be able to install and start jsreport on your development machine you need to do following.

1. install nodejs
2. clone this repository
3. npm install
4. npm start

You may find installation troubleshooting guide specific for your platform [here](https://github.com/jsreport/docs/tree/master/installation).

See [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for build automation options.

###Environments
jsreport adapts to `production` and `development` nodejs environments. Difference is that in `production` environment you get javascript files combined and minified for fast web application startup opposite to `development` environment where you get all js files individually what makes debugging easier. Second difference is that in `production` environment jsreport use `prod.config.json` as configuration file opposite to `dev.config.json` in `development.

To change environment use cmd `set NODE_ENV=development` or use options your IDE provides. If you don't specify node environment jsreport assumes production as default.

###Configurations
jsreport loads `dev.config.json` or `prod.config.json` configuration file on start up based on nodejs environment. If configuration file is not found, jsreport creates default configuration file from `example.config.json`.

See [config](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/config.md) documentation for details.

###Tests

 **grunt test** - start tests with file system based db (neDb), no mongo needed

 **grunt test-mongo** - start tests with mongo db, mongodb must be running on localhost

 **grunt test-all** - start tests with nedb and then once again with mongo (used with travis CI)

 **grunt test-integration** - start all tests with nedb including integration tests,  needs java, fop and phantomjs running

##Contributions

jsreport is split into many separated repositories usually representing reusable libraries. All of the repositories accepts
pull requests without further complications. Only this main jsreport repository currently requires you to send us a
signed [contributor license agreement](http://jsreport.net/CopyrightAssignmentAgreement.pdf). This will be required only
for limited time until we will separate this repository into free GPL licensed jsreport and repository with payed enterprise features.

To motivate contributions we provide free enterprise licenses to contributors.

##Roadmap

Following we have in mind for the upcoming release 1.0

- **drag and drop designer**
- electron based studio and client application
- new recipes using electron to print pdf
- new default template storage using [jsreport-fs-store](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport-fs-store)
- extracting the core part of jsreport into the extra repository
- sql based template storage
- tons of new extensions, recipes, engines....
